Given:
a encoded to 1
b encoded to 2
....
z encoded to 26

You can translate a number to a string:

'123' can be translated to 'abc'
but also can be translated to 'aw','lc' which gives 3 total translations
'12' can be translated to 'ab' and 'l' -> 2 translations

Write a function to get the number of valid combinations from a number like '123123123'
